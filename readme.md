## ts-app-logger
**This source code is experimental and a WIP.**

This package is responsible for defining our application logger. Our application logger allows for class logging via decorators for easy tracing, wraps console logs, and has simple built-in filtering. 

See [https://github.com/tsapporg/ts-app-docs](https://github.com/tsapporg/ts-app-docs) for documentation.
